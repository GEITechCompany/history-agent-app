Client was fine with sometime next week and he would like to be confirmed with first before proceeding.

apparenlty alot of the eaves are clear just the back part has leaves.

Talked about needing to seal something and use a scraper for something on the bottom of the eaves at the four corners of the house. he said the downpipes are fine. 

Im not sure if what he was talking about we are already covering in the DP cleaning services.
Please look into.

RESCHEDULE - SEND ROHAN - josiah booked-  do not mvoe",,,,,"BRIAN IN TCV SCHEDULING CHAT: I got a call from 70 Heritage Estates Road and says the dripping is still happening after todays' rain.

I'm thinking that perhaps the leak is NOT from inside the eaves but from the water running along the outside and accumulating at the joint on the outside. 

I say this because we've repaired it twice and thus doesn't make sense. The only way to test if the inside is completely sealed is to take a bucket of water and pour it carefully into the eaves without any getting on the outside and see if it still leaks. I'm thinking it won't. If is still likes, then we've obviously done a bad repair. 

Unfortunately, we need to go back.

she responded via Resi

Hello Passion,

Thank you for your message. I understand the need to move the window cleaning date, and I have also blocked time out of my work schedule because I see clients at home.

What would work for me is if the rescheduled time for the windows could happen either Dec 2nd between 1:30-3:30 or first thing on Dec 3rd.

Please let me know if that can work. 

I'm sorry I'm not able to be as flexible because of my work situation, which is why I book so far in advance.

With gratitude,


(NOV 25 IS BOOKED FOR EAVES STILL. THERE IS A DUPLICATE WITH THE EAVES JOB ON IT.) 11/21/24 L)

""URGENT

Pony club on Queen street - 1983 Queen Street E

Asking for their sign to be cleaned 

Water-fed would be good 
If you can think of another way to clean that then there you go 

If I remember correctly we quoted $50.00 I could be wrong - may consider discounting. Or free of charge since they have been waiting a while 

Instruction from Audie - do not try to couple this with other route water-fed uppers - just get this done for now because they are asking.""

Idea: Could be done tomorrow if Richmond could use WF backpack, he is on beaches route. If so need to charge backpack.
Also from Kaleigh: May have already called pony club about the price, don't remember clearly - consider confirming quote with them and solidifying date before cleaning.

NOTES:  no post construction, scraping or anything like that (no decals either) just a standard cleaning, and if there are objects in the way we skip the windows, anything you can reach with an 6-8 foot pole, no high windows like slanted roofs. interior cleaning rule of thumb: we never do the whole thing. Each time you go you do about 25% of it, always make sure to do the doors. That way it stays fairly clean.

Use dollar store receipt book, right Supershine janitorial on the top and then in the description right Window Cleaning, A stamp is not required for FreshCo locations.

if they are asked how often the windows are done, they should say that they don’t know and that the company sends lots of different crews. - Kris

Would you like the windows cleaned that have screens attached them? 

If so, there will be a $1-$5 screen removal charge based on the size and difficulty.  

Please keep in mind the technician would inform you of the screen removal charge before proceeding.

To get sizer lift control panel you need to call the store number to have 
Security bring it down for you. Not knowing this costed us at least 2 hours. No contacts or any other info was available to make the process easier. There also was a crackhead that wouldn't leave us alone, he kept trying to 'help' us, I'm unsure how much time this took up. In the future I'd personally take money out of my pocket to pay someone like that off just to leave. 
There was also a fire next door which caused many people to get in the way of work, this caused about a 30 min delay as there were about 100 people in the way

No pressure washing. The inside windows just focus on the frames make sure they’re dust free and do a quick wash on them. Nothing major.

There is no work in the back of the store in the receiving area like there was at the no-frills in Mount Forest. It’s just the main store. Same deal as before, thoroughly dusting all ceiling fans, HVAC system, security, camera, light fixtures, water pipes, anything in the ceiling. Rafters where dust is visible from the ground. I’m told there’s a lot of spiderwebs, so that should be a good focus. Also, we are vacuuming and dusting on top of the fridges and coolers like last time as well, removing any debris that’s up there.

Laszlo: 

She mentioned she referred our company to another person. I told her that both her and the person she referred would get a 15% DSCOUNT FOR REFFERAL. 

In addition she would like to book her yearly window cleaning in the next two weeks. 

And her are eaves cleaned when more leaves are falling 

She has an important question: She was wondering if the 15% discount can be applied to both her window cleaning in two weeks AND the eaves she will be booking later. I did not give her an answer and said Passion will answer this. 

EMELIA GOT CONFIRMATION FROM PASSION TO TELL HER NO - THE 15% WILL BE APPLIED ONLY AFTER YOUR REFERRAL HAS PAID FOR THEIR SERVICE - BE DIRECT SHE TALKS ALLOT - THE ANASWER IS NO.

client wants sealing after power washing. He is open to use our company for both power-washing and sealing. around the knots still green. 

When previous contractor came, he came with scrub only. olympic premium. green gobbler brand.

we would do power-washing instead. He would like to know about the chemicals used in the power-washer before moving forward with the job. 

client mentioned a combination of sodium bicarbonate / oxalate acid might do the trick.

He Emelia,

As you know, I had my windows and eaves done recently. Rohad (Not sure of spelling) did a great job.

He told me that he noticed a few things on the roof that I would like to discuss with you.

1- There is a spot within the eavestrough that is pooling water. If will freeze this winter and cause potential problems. He mentioned that Parker’s has a service whereby you empty the pooled water and clean it out, for the winter. I would like you to quote me for that and schedule me in to have it done perhaps early or mid- December — so that it will be cold enough that it won’t rain anymore, but the water there hasn’t froze yet.

2- To fix the above issue permanently, Rohan suggested that in the Spring, I hire Parker’s to slope the eavestrough so it does not pool again. I would like to hire Parker’s next spring to do that. I’ll add that to my Spring Cleaning list but I wanted to give you a heads-up on that Service.

Thanks so much and I look forward to hearing from you re: clearing out the pooled water.

Kindly,
Jane

Client paid $210 instead of what we invoiced him- $197.75. 
Client stated because apparently that was what was on the estimate. Client said to apply the difference to the next job.

Did not reply, left email in inbox.

This was my bad. I did not pay attention that when the invoice is made the discount amount is automatically removed and I charged the client the amount without the discount. Did not have time to address client. I apologize and will pay attention to this moving forward. (11/20/24 L)

11/22/24 pa: client says I would like to proceed, but there are still lots of leaves on 2 Japanese maples here. Can I still wait until they are gone? What is the very latest date I can be booked in?

pa replied: We are striving to book all our eaves cleanings within the next two weeks due to the forecast of colder weather.

We would recommend booking sooner than later, as we are unable to guarantee being able to complete the eaves if they freeze.

Our bookings team will provide an available date shortly, and we can always reschedule if needed.

Please let us know if you have any questions, comments, or concerns.

It is actually faster to do by hand as there is so much to clean up when we use a blower.

Each time you go you do about 25% of it, always make sure to do the doors. That way it stays fairly clean.

Use dollar store receipt book, right Supershine janitorial on the top and then in the description right Window Cleaning, you need to get a manager to sign it and stamp it. Every store has a store stamp. 

if they are asked how often the windows are done, they should say that they don’t know and that the company sends lots of different crews. - Kris

Hello,
What’s going on with my windows?
I was a funeral with my family out of town.
I got several calls and a message.
I believe I made it very clear about not being there.
I’m hoping the windows were done and completed.
I was
asked to respond about calcium on the window or something similar.
I understand you are trying to operate your business.
The person doing the windows at 39 Sugar was amazing and if I have gone to the effort
to clean my windows I want and hope and expect they will be clean. 
I’m a little frustrated.
Angé 

11/09/24 passion replied with tech report

CLIENT LEFT A MESSAGE REGARDING HER FRUSTRATION TO BE CONTACTED VIA PHONE MULTIPLE TIMES ON THE DAY OF HER CLEANING AS WELL AS RECEIVING AND EMAIL...

Hi, good morning. It is Angela con I am in Leamington, Ontario. I am at a celebration of life. Yeah, I specifically mentioned that the that the Windows would need extra care. That is what I am frustrated about. And so, you know, being called when I am not available and then having to deal with another email and a text message, etc. Etc, that is what I was trying to avoid, right there is a management concept called Touch at once, I do not want to have to touch it 15 times right now, somebody is going to have to come back and I have to make sure the water's on etc. Etc etc. It is already annoying because I want the indoor windows done as well, right? I know you are trying to run a business, but I am also trying to run my life. Okay, my mom's not well, my dog's not well, I am out of town. I am helping my friend with a dog. So anyway, I am I am a little bit irritated. Because it went so awesome when I was at Sugar Mill way the guy did everything, now it was on site, okay?

FOLLOWING UP WITH AUDIE REGARDING THIS - WE MAY WANT TO SMOOTH THINGS OVER WITH HER ON MONDAY

SIDE NOTE: MAY HAVE TO RETURN FOR THE 2 WINDOWS THAT HAVE CALCIUM DEPOSITS ON THEM (GIVE FOR FREE?)

MISSED BIZCON CALL

NEED TO CALL HER BACK AND SAY THAT WE APOLOGIZE THE FRUSTRATION - WE COULD NOT PROCEED WITH EXTRA SERVICES WITHOUT CONFIRMING ADDITIONAL FEES - BUT FOR THE SITUATION WE'D LIKE TO GIVE YOU THE CALCIUM DEPOSIT REMOVAL AT NO CHARGE FOR THE TWO WINDOWS THAT THE TECHNICIAN MENTIONED. OUR BOOKINGS TEAM WILL REACH OUT SOON TO SET THAT UP FOR YOU...

Hello Yafit,

We have an availability to perform your eaves cleaning today (12/18/24). Please let us know if this works for you. Please keep in mind you do not need to be home during the service. The charge would be $185 pre HST. If today does not work, we would like to request that due to the unpredictable weather, we would come unannounced and perform the services (notifying you upon completion).

I would suggest tomorrow calling the client and emailing the client of a date (next week during warm spell)

12/20/24 this client already got it done unfortunately - they were able to get it done by someone else on the specific day that they requested so we missed the chance - I did offer the client a 10% discount if she decides to go with our company next time - she requested an email regarding this.

NEED 3RD PERSON TO JOIN OR BOOK FOR WEDNESDAY NOV13 TO FINISH LEFT OVERS 

FROM BRIAN

FYI.  A HUGE job ($5,000+) just added to EAST tab that must be done before NOV 13th

 ""FYI.  Added a QUOTE job to the Central tab. Quote needs to be done ASAP and then schedule cleaning for later in the month.  Details are on the spreadsheet. Needs experienced crew.  The skylight client wants cleaned will be challenging. Says that pole does not do a good job.  We need to assess with onsite visit.

How many will be onsite?  I need to let them know.  It's obviously a high-end contract with a fenced lot.

Job is CONFIRMED. 

Note that Wednesday can be used as an opportunity to complete the job if necessary. 

I would still HIGHLY RECOMMEND more than just a few at this project due to the size. Remember, it is a $5,100 job and just on that alone it should be obvious that a two man crew could never finish it in one day.

Also the days are now shorter for daylight.

THE BIG JOB IS TO BE ""CANCELLED"".  They spoke to the other partners and have decided NOT to go through because of cost. 

They hinted that they might do the eaves?  Don't know but will keep you informed. In the meantime. CANCEL!!!""

pa replied: We are striving to book all our eaves cleanings within the next two weeks due to the forecast of colder weather.

We would recommend booking sooner than later, as we are unable to guarantee being able to complete the eaves if they freeze.

Our bookings team will provide an available date shortly, and we can always reschedule if needed.

Please let us know if you have any questions, comments, or concerns.

Hello Ruth,

We hope all is well.

Regarding, today's cleaning our onsite technician confirmed that the quote for the cleaning is more accurately priced at $295 for the exterior window cleaning and $325 for the interior window cleaning. 

We acknowledge and apologize that the technician did not inform you before proceeding with the cleaning, as a result for this time we will keep the current price estimated as it is, and will adjust the price for future cleanings.

Please let us know if you have any comments, questions or concerns.

Hello,
What’s going on with my windows?
I was a funeral with my family out of town.
I got several calls and a message.
I believe I made it very clear about not being there.
I’m hoping the windows were done and completed.
I was
asked to respond about calcium on the window or something similar.
I understand you are trying to operate your business.
The person doing the windows at 39 Sugar was amazing and if I have gone to the effort
to clean my windows I want and hope and expect they will be clean. 
I’m a little frustrated.
Angé 

11/09/24 passion replied with tech report

CLIENT LEFT A MESSAGE REGARDING HER FRUSTRATION TO BE CONTACTED VIA PHONE MULTIPLE TIMES ON THE DAY OF HER CLEANING AS WELL AS RECEIVING AND EMAIL...

Hi, good morning. It is Angela con I am in Leamington, Ontario. I am at a celebration of life. Yeah, I specifically mentioned that the that the Windows would need extra care. That is what I am frustrated about. And so, you know, being called when I am not available and then having to deal with another email and a text message, etc. Etc, that is what I was trying to avoid, right there is a management concept called Touch at once, I do not want to have to touch it 15 times right now, somebody is going to have to come back and I have to make sure the water's on etc. Etc etc. It is already annoying because I want the indoor windows done as well, right? I know you are trying to run a business, but I am also trying to run my life. Okay, my mom's not well, my dog's not well, I am out of town. I am helping my friend with a dog. So anyway, I am I am a little bit irritated. Because it went so awesome when I was at Sugar Mill way the guy did everything, now it was on site, okay?

Appreciate the quick response.  The quote is higher than we had anticipated – your previous one was $325, including window cleaning.  We have nothing out of the ordinary, but we do have a shed with gutters in the back which we ask to be included.

Hello Passion,

Thank you for your message. I understand the need to move the window cleaning date, and I have also blocked time out of my work schedule because I see clients at home.

What would work for me is if the rescheduled time for the windows could happen either Dec 2nd between 1:30-3:30 or first thing on Dec 3rd.

Please let me know if that can work.

I’m not sure where the eavestrough extender was placed before but I tried to put it back where I thought it should be. I think we have to give a discount or free.. the technician should have checked to see if air or water could flow through the pipe, that is a basic and standard procedure.

I think we have leaf guards but looking at the small tree growing up there it appears there might be some clogging.

Also when doing the work be aware that we also have squirrel guards that must not be removed or disturbed since they protect the solar panels from being damaged by squirrels.

STANDARD DOWNPIPE CLEARING IS COMPLIMENTARY.  
DISSASEMBLY IF NECESSARY (EXTREME CLOGGING) IS $35.00 PER DOWNPIPE. WILL QUOTE ONSITE.

NOTE: CLEANING UNDER GUTTER GUARDS. $30.00 PER 15MINS OF WORK. WILL QUOTE ON SITE. DEPENDANT ON HOW DIRTY AND WHAT SECTIONS NEED CLEANING.

WILL PROVIDE A QUOTE ONSITE FOR THE CUSTOMER TO REVIEW AND ASSESS IF THEY WOULD LIKE TO PROCEED.

$13 per ft. + $120 installation fee. Eaves Cleaning and Down Spouts included for the installation area. Gutter guards are just one layer of protection that still need to be serviced because of accumulated debris. Regular cleaning of the guards enables water flow and ensures maximum effectiveness of your eaves guards.
Note: Eaves Guard Removal is a separate service.

Measured 91ft of eaves for gutter guard quote.

Got measurement wrong, it’s actually 106ft. Client is fine with the updated price.
(13$ per foot. 13/106: $1378. +$120 installation fee)

TOTAL QUOTE: $1498.00


One section of small eave I could not install the guard on, ladder set up and roof walk was not safe. Spoke to client, she’s fine with us coming back to finish it. Schedule it in for a warm day. Anyone that’s going that’s not Rohan please tell them to call Rohan on site to confirm which eave it is.

additional info from client: It would be helpful if your cleaners could take pictures.
