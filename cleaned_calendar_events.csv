I've quoted the job at $317 OUT only, but without the post construction add-on. The owner says the windows are not that bad, but I've heard that before. His major concern is what sounds like stucco paint on some of the frames. I need someone to do a site visit ASAP to assess how bad the job is. TASK: ASSESS POST CONSTRUCTION PRICING FOR WINDOWS AS WELL AS THE FRAMES AND PROVIDE A BREAKDOWN. CORRESPOND WITH BRIAN FOR ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS Send to Brian TOTAL WINDOW COUNT: 28 Medium 16 large 3 X-Large (also 4 large railing glass on porch if they want cleaned, no visible post-construction) -Light post-construction on front of house -medium post-construction on back and sides of house -some grout on some of the frames in front of the house, not too much -stucco/stucco paint on almost every window frame at back and sides of house (extensively on 3 large window frames) Some comes off with soap and water but mostly not. Maybe a chemical can take it off? Rubbing alcohol? Can’t promise how they will turn out after complete -stucco paint spray on 3 doors and frames of doors around house (see pictures) It can be removed with soap and water with a decent amount of effort. Maybe use rubbing alcohol would help? Can’t promise how it will look when completed -back porch: Heavy post-construction on back porch windows 3 large & 2 medium windows. Frames also have some stucco paint spattering -protective plastic on 2 large windows that will need to be removed. Seems like it will come off fairly easily (see pictures)","CONFIRMED","2024-04-17 20:57","2024-04-18 15:26"

Each time you go you do about 25% of it, always make sure to do the doors. That way it stays fairly clean. You’ll have to get a dollar store receipt book, right Supershine janitorial on the top and then in the description right Window Cleaning, you need to get a manager to sign it and stamp it.

I raised the downspout by about a foot to solve this and added an elbow as well. To be 100% certain the client requested all the seams to be caulked. ‼️FOR FUTURE CLEANINGS. DUMP A BUCKET OF WATER DOWN THE BACK DOWNSPOUT TO BE SURE IT FLOWS OUT. THERE IS A VERY LONG PLASTIC ACCORDION TAKING THE WAYER TO THE BACK. BE SURE IT’S CLEAR! ‼️Client might want a downspout installed on the back left side of the house. He was informed of the price of installation $375 ‼️there is a hole from a downspout in his garage right side eaves that the client would like repaired next time we are at his house.
